# Optimization-of-heart-disease-prediction-using-machine-learning-techniques

## Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques. By optimizing various models, the goal is to achieve high accuracy and provide reliable predictions based on user input. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and the development of a user-friendly frontend to make predictions. This work is co-authored in **IJCRT** as part of a publication.

## Implementation Details

### Level 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Heart disease dataset loaded.
- Missing values filled, duplicates removed, and data standardized.

### Level 2: Data Splitting
- Dataset split into training (75%) and testing (25%) subsets.

### Level 3: Model Training
- Trained using various ML algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - KNN
  - SVC
  - Na√Øve Bayes
  - Decision Tree
  - XGBoost

### Level 4: Performance Evaluation
- Tested models for accuracy and finalized the best-performing algorithm.

### Level 5: Final Model and User Input
- Developed a front-end for users to input data and receive predictions based on the finalized model.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python (version 3.6.8)
- **Libraries**: pandas, scikit-learn, Flask, XGBoost
- **Database**: MySQL (using PyMySQL library for integration)
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Server**: XAMPP (Apache, MySQL)
